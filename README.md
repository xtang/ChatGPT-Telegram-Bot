ChatGPT Telegram Bot is a powerful Telegram bot that can use various mainstream large language model APIs, including GPT-3.5/4/4 Turbo/4o/o1, DALL¬∑E 3, Claude2.1/3/3.5 API, Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash, Vertex AI (Claude series/Gemini series), Groq Mixtral-8x7b/LLaMA2-70b, and DuckDuckGo (gpt-4o-mini, claude-3-haiku, Meta-Llama-3.1-70B, Mixtral-8x7B). It enables users to have efficient conversations and information searches on Telegram.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple AI Models**: Supports GPT-3.5/4/4 Turbo/4o/o1, DALL¬∑E 3, Claude2.1/3/3.5 API, Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash, Vertex AI (Claude series/Gemini series), Groq Mixtral-8x7b/LLaMA2-70b and DuckDuckGo (gpt-4o-mini, claude-3-haiku, Meta-Llama-3.1-70B, Mixtral-8x7B). Also supports one-api/new-api/[uni-api](https://github.com/yym68686/uni-api). Utilizes self-developed API to request backend [SDK](https://github.com/yym68686/ModelMerge), does not rely on OpenAI SDK.
- **Multimodal Question Answering**: Supports question answering for voice, audio, images, and PDF/TXT/MD/python documents. Users can directly upload files in the chat box for use.

| claude_api_key | Claude official API key. | No |
| CLAUDE_API_URL | If you are using the Anthropic official API, you don't need to set this. If you using a third-party Anthropic API, you need to fill in the third-party proxy website. The default is: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages | No |
| NICK | The default is empty, and NICK is the name of the bot. The bot will only respond when the message starts with NICK that the user inputs, otherwise the bot will respond to any message. Especially in group chats, if there is no NICK, the bot will reply to all messages. | No |
| GOOGLE_API_KEY | If you need to use Google search, you need to set it. If you do not set this environment variable, the bot will default to provide duckduckgo search. | No |
| GOOGLE_CSE_ID | If you need to use Google search, you need to set it together with GOOGLE_API_KEY. | No |
| whitelist | Set which users can access the bot, and connect the user IDs authorized to use the bot with ','. The default value is `None`, which means that the bot is open to everyone. | No |
| BLACK_LIST | Set which users are prohibited from accessing the bot, and connect the user IDs authorized to use the bot with ','. The default value is `None` | No |
| ADMIN_LIST | Set up an admin list. Only admins can use the `/info` command to configure the bot. | No |
| GROUP_LIST | Set up a list of groups that can use the bot. Connect the group IDs with a comma (','). Even if group members are not on the whitelist, as long as the group ID is in the GROUP_LIST, all members of the group can use the bot. | No |
| CUSTOM_MODELS | Set a list of custom model names. Use commas (',') to connect model names. If you need to remove a default model, add a hyphen (-) before the default model name. To remove all default models, use `-all`. | No |

The default is `None`. The setting of the system prompt is only effective when `CHAT_MODE` is `global`. When `CHAT_MODE` is `multiusers`, the system prompt environment variable will not modify any user's system prompt regardless of its value, because users do not want their set system to be changed to a global system prompt. | No |
| LANGUAGE | Specifies the default language displayed by the bot, including button display language and dialogue language. The default is `English`. Currently, it only supports setting to the following four languages: `English`, `Simplified Chinese`, `Traditional Chinese`, `Russian`. You can also use the `/info` command to set the display language after the bot is deployed. | No |
| CONFIG_DIR | Specify storage user profile folder. CONFIG_DIR is the folder for storing user configurations. Each time the bot starts, it reads the configurations from the CONFIG_DIR folder, so users won't lose their previous settings every time they restart. you can achieve configuration persistence by mounting folders using the `-v` parameter when deploying locally with Docker. Default is `user_configs`. | No |
| RESET_TIME | Specifies how many seconds the bot resets the chat history. Every RESET_TIME seconds, the bot will reset the chat history for all users except the admin list. The reset time for each user is different, calculated based on the last question time of each user to determine the next reset time. It is not all users resetting at the same time. The default value is `3600` seconds, and the minimum value is `60` seconds. | No |

The following is a list of environment variables related to robot preferences. Preferences can also be set after the robot is started by using the `/info` command and clicking the `Preferences` button:

| Variable Name | Description | Required? |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| PASS_HISTORY | The default value is `9999`. The bot will remember the conversation history and consider the context in the next reply.

Remove environment variables

```bash
flyctl secrets unset MY_SECRET DATABASE_URL
```

ssh to fly.io container

```bash
flyctl ssh issue --agent
# ssh connection
flyctl ssh establish
```

Check whether the webhook URL is correct

```bash
https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getWebhookInfo
```

## Docker Local Deployment

Start the container

```bash
docker run -p 80:8080 --name chatbot -dit \
    -e BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token \
    -e API= \
    -e API_URL= \
    -v ./user_configs:/home/user_configs \
    yym68686/chatgpt:latest
```

Or if you want to use Docker Compose, here is a docker-compose.yml example:

```yaml
version: "3.5"
services:
  chatgptbot:
    container_name: chatgptbot
    image: yym68686/chatgpt:latest
    environment:
      - BOT_TOKEN=
      - API=
      - API_URL=
    volumes:
      - ./user_configs:/home/user_configs
    ports:
      - 80:8080
```

Run Docker Compose container in the background

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d

# uni-api
docker-compose -f docker-compose-uni-api.yml up -d
```

Package the Docker image in the repository and upload it to Docker Hub

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t chatgpt:latest -f Dockerfile.build --platform linux/amd64 .
docker tag chatgpt:latest yym68686/chatgpt:latest
docker push yym68686/chatgpt:latest
```

One-Click Restart Docker Image

```bash
set -eu
docker pull yym68686/chatgpt:latest
docker rm -f chatbot
docker run -p 8080:8080 -dit --name chatbot \
-e BOT_TOKEN= \
-e API= \
-e API_URL= \
-e GOOGLE_API_KEY= \
-e GOOGLE_CSE_ID= \
-e claude_api_key= \
-v ./user_configs:/home/user_configs \
yym68686/chatgpt:latest
docker logs -f chatbot
```

This script is for restarting the Docker image with a single command. It first removes the existing Docker container named "chatbot" if it exists. Then, it runs a new Docker container with the name "chatbot", exposing port 8080 and setting various environment variables. The Docker image used is "yym68686/chatgpt:latest". Finally, it follows the logs of the "chatbot" container.

## üöÄ Source code Local Deployment

Run the robot directly from the source code without using docker, Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 -b main --quiet https://github.com/yym68686/ChatGPT-Telegram-Bot.git
```

Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set Environment Variables:

```bash
export BOT_TOKEN=
export API=
```

Run:

```bash
python bot.py
```

## üß© Plugin

The robot supports multiple plugins, including: DuckDuckGo and Google search, URL summary, ArXiv paper summary, DALLE-3 drawing, and code interpreter, etc. You can enable or disable these plugins by setting environment variables.

- How to develop a plugin?

All the code related to the plugin is in the git submodule ModelMerge within this repository. ModelMerge is an independent repository I developed to handle API requests, conversation history management, and other functionalities. When you clone this repository using the --recurse-submodules parameter, ModelMerge will be automatically downloaded locally. All the plugin code is located in this repository at the relative path `ModelMerge/src/ModelMerge/plugins`. You can add your own plugin code in this directory. The plugin development process is as follows:

1. Create a new Python file in the `ModelMerge/src/ModelMerge/plugins` directory, for example, `myplugin.py`. In the `ModelMerge/src/ModelMerge/plugins/__init__.py` file, import your plugin, for example, `from .myplugin import MyPlugin`.

2. In the `ModelMerge/src/ModelMerge/tools/chatgpt.py` file, add your plugin OpenAI tool format detailed request body to the `function_call_list` variable. The Claude Gemini tool does not require additional writing; you only need to fill in the OpenAI format tool request body. The program will automatically convert to Claude/Gemini tool format when requesting the Gemini or Claude API. `function_call_list` is a dictionary where the key is the name of the plugin, and the value is the request body of the plugin. Please ensure that the key names in the `function_call_list` dictionary are unique and do not duplicate the existing plugin key names.

3. Add key-value pairs to the `PLUGINS` dictionary in `ModelMerge/src/ModelMerge/plugins/config.py`, where the key is the name of the plugin and the value is the environment variable of the plugin and its default value. This default value acts as the switch for the plugin. If the default value is `True`, the plugin is enabled by default. If the default value is `False`, the plugin is disabled by default and needs to be manually enabled by the user in the `/info` command.

4. Finally, in the functions `get_tools_result_async` inside `ModelMerge/src/ModelMerge/plugins/config.py`, add the code for invoking the plugin. When the robot needs to call the plugin, it will call this function. You need to add the plugin invocation code inside this function.

After completing the above steps, your plugin can be used in the bot. üéâ

## üìÑ Frequently Asked Questions

- What is the use of the WEB_HOOK environment variable? How should it be used?

WEB_HOOK is a webhook address. Specifically, when a Telegram bot receives a user message, it sends the message to the Telegram server, which then forwards the message to the server at the WEB_HOOK address set by the bot. Therefore, when a message is sent to the bot, the bot executes the processing program almost immediately. Receiving messages via WEB_HOOK results in faster response times than when WEB_HOOK is not set.

When deploying a bot using platforms like Zeabur, Replit, or Koyeb, these platforms provide you with a domain name that you need to fill in the WEB_HOOK, so the bot can receive user messages. Of course, not setting WEB_HOOK is also possible, but the bot's response time will be slightly longer, although the difference is not significant, so generally setting WEB_HOOK is not necessary.

When deploying a bot on a server, you need to use reverse proxy tools like nginx or caddy to forward messages sent by the Telegram server to your server, so the bot can receive user messages. Therefore, you need to set WEB_HOOK to your server's domain name and forward the traffic requesting WEB_HOOK to the server and corresponding port where the bot is located. For example, in caddy, you can configure it like this in the caddy configuration file /etc/caddy/Caddyfile:

```caddy
your_webhook_domain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8082
}
```

- Why can't I use Google search?

By default, DuckDuckGo search is provided. The official API for Google search needs to be applied for by the user. It can provide real-time information that GPT could not answer before, such as today's trending topics on Weibo, today's weather in a specific location, and the progress of a certain person or news event.

- Why can't I use the search function even though I added the Google search API?

There are two possibilities:

1. Only large language model (LLM) APIs that support tool usage can use the search function. Currently, this project only supports the search function for APIs of the OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini series models. APIs from other model providers are not supported for tool usage in this project at the moment. If you have a model provider you wish to adapt, you can contact the maintainer.

2. If you are using the APIs of OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini series models but cannot use the search function, it may be because the search function is not enabled. You can check whether the search function is enabled by clicking on preferences through the `/info` command.

3. If you are using the API of OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini series models, please ensure you are using the official API. If you are using a third-party relay API, the provider may be offering you the API through web scraping. APIs provided through web scraping cannot use tools use, meaning that all plugins of this project cannot be used. If you confirm that you are using the official API and still cannot search successfully, please contact the developer.

- How do I switch models?

You can switch between GPT3.5/4/4o, and other models using the "/info" command in the chat window.

- Can it be deployed in a group?

Yes, it supports whitelist to prevent abuse and information leakage.

- Why can't the bot talk when I add it to the group?

If this is the first time you add the bot to a group chat, you need to set the group privacy to disable in botfather, then remove the bot from the group chat and re-add it to use it normally.

The second method is to set the bot as an administrator, so the bot can be used normally. However, if you want to add the bot to a group chat where you are not an administrator, the first method is more suitable.

Another possibility is that the GROUP_LIST set is not the current group chat ID. Please check if GROUP_LIST is set; GROUP_LIST is the group ID, not the group name. The group ID starts with a minus sign followed by a string of numbers.

- How do the settings of GROUP_LIST, ADMIN_LIST, and whitelist affect the behavior of the bot?

If whitelist is not set, everyone can use the bot. If whitelist is set, only users in the whitelist can use the bot. If GROUP_LIST is set, only groups in the GROUP_LIST can use the bot. If both whitelist and GROUP_LIST are set, everyone in the group can use the bot, but only users in the whitelist can privately chat with the bot. If ADMIN_LIST is set, only users in the ADMIN_LIST can use the /info command to change the bot's settings. If ADMIN_LIST is not set, everyone can use the /info command to change the bot's configuration.

- How should I set the API_URL?

The API_URL supports all suffixes, including: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions, https://api.openai.com/v1, and https://api.openai.com/. The bot will automatically allocate different endpoints based on different uses.

- Is it necessary to configure the web_hook environment variable?

The web_hook is not a mandatory environment variable. You only need to set the domain name (which must be consistent with WEB_HOOK) and other environment variables as required for your application's functionality.

- I deployed a robot with docker compose. If the documentation is placed on the server locally, which directory should it be mounted to in order to take effect? Do I need to set additional configurations and modify the code?

You can directly send the documentation to the robot through the chat box, and the robot will automatically parse the documentation. To use the documentation dialogue function, you need to enable the historical conversation feature. There is no need for additional processing of the documentation.

- I still can't get it to work... I want to use it in a group, I've set the ADMIN_LIST to myself, and the GROUP_LIST to that group, with the whitelist left empty. However, only I can use it in that group, other members in the group are prompted with no permission, what's going on?

Here's a troubleshooting guide: Please carefully check if the GROUP_LIST is correct. The ID of a Telegram group starts with a negative sign followed by a series of numbers. If it's not, please use this bot [bot](https://t.me/getidsbot) to reacquire the group ID.

- I've uploaded a document, but it's not responding based on the content of the document. What's going on?

To use the document question and answer feature, you must first enable the history record. You can turn on the history record through the `/info` command, or by setting the environment variable `PASS_HISTORY` to be greater than to 2 to enable the history record by default. Please note that enabling the history record will incur additional costs, so this project does not enable the history record by default. This means that the question and answer feature cannot be used under the default settings. Before using this feature, you need to manually enable the history record.

- After setting the `NICK`, there's no response when I @ the bot, and it only replies when the message starts with the nick. How can I make it respond to both the nick and @botname?

In a group chat scenario, if the environment variable `NICK` is not set, the bot will receive all group messages and respond to all of them. Therefore, it is necessary to set `NICK`. After setting `NICK`, the bot will only respond to messages that start with `NICK`. So, if you want to @ the bot to get a response, you just need to set NICK to @botname. This way, when you @ the bot in the group, the bot will detect that the message starts with @botname, and it will respond to the message.

- How many messages will the history keep?

All other models use the official context length settings, for example, the `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` context is 16k, the `gpt-4o` context is 128k, and the `Claude3/3.5` context is 200k. This limitation is implemented to save user costs, as most scenarios do not require a high context.

- How to delete the default model name from the model list?

You can use the `CUSTOM_MODELS` environment variable to complete it. For example, if you want to add gpt-4o and remove the gpt-3.5 model from the model list, please set `CUSTOM_MODELS` to `gpt-4o,-gpt-3.5`. If you want to delete all default models at once, you can set `CUSTOM_MODELS` to `-all,gpt-4o`.

- How does conversation isolation specifically work?

Conversations are always isolated based on different windows, not different users. This means that within the same group chat window, the same topic, and the same private chat window, it is considered the same conversation. CHAT_MODE only affects whether configurations are isolated. In multi-user mode, each user's plugin configurations, preferences, etc., are independent and do not affect each other. In single-user mode, all users share the same plugin configurations and preferences. However, conversation history is always isolated. Conversation isolation is to protect user privacy, ensuring that users' conversation history, plugin configurations, preferences, etc., are not visible to other users.

- Why hasn't the Docker image been updated for a long time?

The Docker image only stores the runtime environment of the program. Currently, the runtime environment of the program is stable, and the environment dependencies have hardly changed, so the Docker image has not been updated. Each time the Docker image is redeployed, it will pull the latest code, so there is no need to worry about the Docker image update issue.

- Why does the container report an error "http connect error or telegram.error.TimedOut: Timed out" after starting?

This issue is likely caused by the server deploying Docker being unable to connect to the Telegram server or the instability of the Telegram server.

1. In most cases, restarting the service, checking the server network environment, or waiting for the Telegram service to recover will suffice.
2. Additionally, you might try communicating with the Telegram server via web hook, which might solve the problem.

- How to make docker retry infinitely instead of stop at beginning?

The `--restart unless-stopped` parameter in Docker sets the container's restart policy. Specifically:

1. unless-stopped: This policy means that the container will automatically restart if it stops, except when it is manually stopped. In other words, if the container stops due to an error or system reboot, it will automatically restart. However, if you manually stop the container (e.g., using the docker stop command), it will not restart on its own.
This parameter is particularly useful for services that need to run continuously, as it ensures that the service will automatically recover from unexpected interruptions without requiring manual intervention.

2. Example: Suppose you have a Docker container running a web server, and you want it to restart automatically if it crashes or if the system reboots, but not if you manually stop it. You can use the following command:

```shell
docker run -d --name my-web-server -p 80:80 --restart unless-stopped my-web-server-image
```
In this example, the web server container named my-web-server will restart automatically unless you manually stop it.

- Switching models, do I need to re-enter the prompt?

Yes, because switching models will reset the history, so you need to re-enter the prompt.

- What is the appropriate value for PASS_HISTORY?

The number of PASS_HISTORY is strictly equal to the number of messages in the conversation history. The recommended value is 2, because the system prompt occupies one message count. If set to 0, PASS_HISTORY will automatically reset to 2 to ensure the conversation proceeds normally. When PASS_HISTORY is less than or equal to 2, the bot's behavior can be regarded as only remembering the current conversation, i.e., one question and one answer, and it will not remember the content of the previous Q&A next time. There is no limit to the maximum value of PASS_HISTORY, but please note that the more messages in the conversation history, the higher the cost of each conversation will be. When PASS_HISTORY is not set, the default value is 9999, indicating that the number of messages in the conversation history is 9999.

- Can Bot tokens have multiple tokens?

No, in the future it will support multiple Bot Tokens.

- How to use robot commands?

1. `/info`: The robot `/info` command can view the robot's configuration information, including the current model in use, API URL, API key, etc. It can also change the robot's display language, preferences, and plugin settings.

2. `/start`: The robot `/start` command can view the robot's usage instructions, usage methods, and function introduction. You can set the API key using the `/start` command. If you have an official OpenAI API key, please use the following command: `/start your_api_key`. If you are using a third-party API key, please use the following command: `/start https://your_api_url your_api_key`.

3. `/reset`: The robot `/reset` command can clear the robot's conversation messages and force the robot to stop generating replies. If you want to reset the system prompt, please use the following command: `/reset your_system_prompt`. However, the `/reset` command will never restore the robot's display language, preferences, plugin settings, model in use, API URL, API key, system prompt, etc.

- What to do if Koyeb deployment fails?

Koyeb's free service can be a bit unstable, so deployment failures are pretty common. You might want to try redeploying, and if that doesn't work, consider switching to another platform. üòä

- Why does the default model name reappear after I use CUSTOM_MODELS to delete it, and then check again with the /info command?

If you deployed using `docker-compose.yml`, do not add quotes around the value of `CUSTOM_MODELS`. Incorrect usage: `CUSTOM_MODELS="gpt-4o,-gpt-3.5"`, otherwise it will cause environment variable parsing errors, resulting in the default model name reappearing. The incorrect way will be parsed as deleting the `gpt-3.5"` model, which will cause the default model name `gpt-3.5` not to be deleted. The correct way to write it is: `CUSTOM_MODELS=gpt-4o,-gpt-3.5`.
